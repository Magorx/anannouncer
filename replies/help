My primer goal is to deliver a message you create with a special CODE to a person that will enter this CODE. Basicly, that's all for now.

/msg_create CODE - init creation of the message with given CODE
/msg_text CODE "text" - sets text of the message to given
/msg_sign CODE - sing a message so that the reciever will know the creator by his @login
/msd_date CODE - put current date to message
/msg_seal CODE - prevents a message from future 

/recieve CODE - look for a message with given CODE
